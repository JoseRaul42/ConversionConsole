# ETL Framework Template

## Description

This ETL Framework Template is designed to simplify and accelerate complex ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) workflows. By leveraging a modular framework, it allows for the decomposition of intricate data steps into manageable units, significantly improving workflow speed. 

Created with the .NET framework, this template serves as a robust starting point for any ETL projects. It's specifically engineered to seamlessly integrate with SQL Server databases, facilitating the efficient execution of stored procedures or the generation of outputs to flat files, depending on the user's requirements. Whether your goal is to streamline database updates or to manage complex data transformation tasks, this template offers a flexible solution to meet diverse ETL needs.

## Features

- **Modular Design:** Break down complex ETL steps into manageable modules for better organization and easier debugging.
- **SQL Server Integration:** Optimized for SQL Server, enabling straightforward execution of stored procedures.
- **Flexible Output Options:** Configure to output data to various formats, including flat files, catering to different use cases.
- **.NET Framework:** Leverages the power and flexibility of the .NET framework for robust application development.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- .NET Framework (version specified)
- SQL Server (version specified)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/etl-framework-template.git

2. **Navigate to the project directory** by entering the following command in the terminal:

    ```bash
    cd etl-framework-template
    ```

3. **Install dependencies** using Visual Studio. This .NET project relies on NuGet packages for various dependencies. To automatically restore these packages, simply open the solution file (`.sln`) in Visual Studio. Visual Studio will prompt you to restore any missing NuGet packages upon building the project.

    If you prefer using the command line, navigate to the project directory and run the following command to manually restore the NuGet packages:

    ```bash
    dotnet restore
    ```

    This command ensures that all the necessary dependencies are correctly installed and up-to-date, making your project ready for development and execution.


4. **Configure your application** settings, such as database connection strings, by editing the `App.Config` file.

5. **Build the project** to verify that everything is set up correctly:

    ```bash
    dotnet build
    ```
